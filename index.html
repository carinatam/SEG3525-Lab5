                Pelvic floor physiotherapy (PFPT) is a specialized branch of
                physiotherapy involving internal and external assessment and
                treatment of the pelvic floor muscles. Those muscles are located
                between the hip bones and the sacrum, and they serve as a bowl
                to support the pelvic organs including the bladder, colon and
                uterus.<br /><br />Every treatment is tailored to your
                individual needs as a client. There is an external examination
                component where the skin, fascia, and muscles of the abdomen,
                lower back, and inner thighs are assessed. There is also an
                internal component to the exam which is done via a digital
                (finger) vaginal and/or rectal exam.

                Massage Therapy provides an alternative health option to help
                alleviate the soft tissue discomfort associated with everyday
                muscular aches and pains, occupational overuse and many chronic
                pain syndromes. If employed early enough, Massage Therapy can
                reduce and eliminate painful muscular patterning associated with
                trauma and injury to the body.<br /><br />
                It includes many techniques. The most common form of massage
                therapy in Western countries is called Swedish or classical
                massage; it is the core of most massage training programs. Other
                styles include sports massage, clinical massage to accomplish
                specific goals such as releasing muscle spasms, and massage
                traditions derived from Eastern cultures, such as Shiatsu and
                Tuina.

                Acupuncture is the practice of penetrating the skin with thin,
                solid, metallic needles which are then activated through gentle
                and specific movements of the practitioner's hands or with
                electrical stimulation. <br /><br />Acupuncture is part of the
                ancient practice of Traditional Chinese medicine. Traditional
                Chinese medicine practitioners believe the human body has more
                than 2,000 acupuncture points connected by pathways or
                meridians. These pathways create an energy flow (Qi, pronounced
                "chee") through the body that is responsible for overall health.
                Disruption of the energy flow can cause disease. By applying
                acupuncture to certain points, it is thought to improve the flow
                of Qi, thereby improving health.

                Naturopathic medicine is a distinct primary health care system
                that blends modern scientific knowledge with traditional and
                natural forms of medicine. The naturopathic philosophy is to
                stimulate the healing power of the body and treat the underlying
                cause of disease. Symptoms of disease are seen as warning
                signals of improper functioning of the body, and unfavourable
                lifestyle habits. Naturopathic Medicine emphasizes disease as a
                process rather than as an entity. In addition to diet and
                lifestyle changes, natural therapies including botanical
                medicine, clinical nutrition, hydrotherapy, homeopathy,
                naturopathic manipulation and traditional Chinese
                medicine/acupuncture, may also be used during treatments.

                Chiropractic treatment is primarily used as a pain relief
                alternative for muscles, joints, bones, and connective tissue,
                such as cartilage, ligaments, and tendons. It is sometimes used
                in conjunction with conventional medical treatment.<br /><br />Chiropractors
                use hands-on spinal manipulation and other alternative
                treatments. The theory is that proper alignment of the body's
                musculoskeletal structure, particularly the spine, will enable
                the body to heal itself without surgery or medication.
                Manipulation is used to restore mobility to joints restricted by
                tissue injury caused by a traumatic event, such as falling, or
                repetitive stress, such as sitting without proper back support.
